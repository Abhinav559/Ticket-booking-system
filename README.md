# Ticket-booking-system

The ticket booking system is my mini project for my 2nd yr B.TECH in Information Technology.
the Project was to create a ticket booking application for the metro system in hyderabad,India.
the project allows the consumer to book a ticket to any station on the map. This helps reduce the waiting times and also keeping in mind the covid situation it will 
encourage users to book tickets from home rather than standing in queues
